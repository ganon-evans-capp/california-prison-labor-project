  - Start off with one bar for prisons, then have other bars come in next to it with scroll

- Next part: show average wages for various California industries, allow for dragging a bar to guess where it should be - maybe do the same four business as before?
- Show how long it would take to purchase goods at that given rate - use Zoom out effect for each bar ---> Build usimg D3
- Something with fire - animation?

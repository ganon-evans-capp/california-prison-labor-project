# California Prison Labor Project (something snappy in the works)

Ganon Evans

## Goal

My trajectory has changed completely instead of looking at Louisiana data, I instead want to make a very engaging digital story about pay for inmates in California's prison system. My goal is to try and focus on animation to try and convey the blatant inequality in the type of work that the prisoners are doing versus how much those jobs would pay otherwise. 

## Data Challenges

No data challenges. I'm using a relatively small amount of summary data to get my points across. Most of the CSV's I'm using are handcoded. I think my biggest struggle has been learning so much about D3 to get things to work. Getting the just the scroll and drag animations took a long time, but I'm starting to understand it more.

## Walk Through

I want people to just have to scroll down through the article as they're reading it. I plan on alternating the more graphical aspects of my webpage with paragraphs explaining things like a traditional news article. One thing I need to develop more is so complex styling to make the most out of space as possible. Other than scrolling, another interactive portion is by clicking and dragging the bar graph to compare how people imagine the prisoner wages are to what they actually end up being. I'd like to continue to edit the bubble portion so that the animation is a bit more fluid there, like its zooming out each time. 

I'd like to add one more final graphic comparing the prison wages nationwide and what an hour's worth of work of one person in each of those states earns when combined together. 

## Questions

{Numbered list of questions for course staff, if any.}

1. Do you think I need more data in my bar graphs? I want to avoid cherry picking, but want to keep the sample size small so I can be very deliberate about the point.
2. I wanted to focus on the animations for my work since that's what I've had the least practice in. They need to be polished a lot, but how do you like them so far? 
3. I want to make a point comparing the firefighter's wage for prisoners versus that for a regular firefighter. I'm curious of what an effective visual way to do this with only two datapoints would be.

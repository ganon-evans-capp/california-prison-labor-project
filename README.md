# Strong Bars, Weaky Pay

Ganon Evans

## Description

This project is a "scrollytelling" article on wages for inmates in California's prison industry. I was inspired by finding the original ACLU report to do some comparisons with how much an inmate makes relative to a worker in the same industry. Graphs were generated using Altair then stylized for the project. The article can also be found hosted at this website.
